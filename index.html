        <p class="lead mb-4">      My name is William Bryant III and I am from Oakland, Ca. I am a first-year student at the University of California, Riverside and interested in data and itâ€™s modern implementations, economics, and fashion. Iâ€™ve run an online clothing brand for about 2 years amassing over 6 thousand Instagram followers, as well as thousands in sales, so I am experienced in marketing as well. After graduating, I intend on using my critical thinking and computational skills in an analytical field such as data analytics, business analytics, or quantitative analytics. I would describe myself as dedicated, results-oriented, resourceful, and collaborative. <br><br>

              I developed an entrepreneurial mindset at a young age, I began first working in 5th grade in search of capital to fund my fashion interest. I took the little bit of money I had and purchased candy in bulk to sell in a populated area of downtown San Francisco. During this venture, I made hundreds of dollars and continued to sell candy until the 7th grade until I was in search of something larger. Toward the end of the 7th grade, I began purchasing rare and exclusive clothing and sneakers and reselling them through outlets such as Grailed or eBay making thousands of dollars in the process until my junior year of high school. In search of a more sustainable income, I found myself continuing my entrepreneurial endeavors in high school through the creation of my own company. During my junior year of high school, I created my own cut and sew clothing brand handling my own marketing, production, and website, making thousands of dollars and shipping clothing to numerous countries around the world. My success in my entrepreneurial endeavors allowed me to learn and develop my skills in coding, sales, communication, and finance.<br><br>

               My experience outside of my entrepreneurial ventures includes working for Marshawn Lynch's Fam F1st Foundation as an instructor aiding in teaching camp attendees design principles and floor plan making. In addition, I also held the role of President of the Business Club at my high school, discussing careers in business, the current state of economics, and stock trends amongst other business-related topics. I also used my leadership skills in a student government position while in high school. With the title of director of communications, I had the job of controlling communication from faculty and the student government to the entire student body. During that time, I instituted live video announcements to be played across campus with the use of graphics, jokes, and live streaming, to solve the issue of low student engagement on campus. I also have taken place in numerous volunteer activities such as a Fairmont Park clean up, aiding in the Bordwell Stratton Center Snow Day, and numerous volunteer opportunities with Piedmont Parks & Rec including a children's Basketball Camp.
